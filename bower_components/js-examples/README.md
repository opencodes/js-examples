# Development tools and package for Javascript

Since frontend development scaled up to a good size, its not easy to maintain it manually. So there are multiple tools and technology introduced to automate some of the process like version management for library, minification to minimize the file, concatenation to join multiple file and so on.

----------

Though there are plenty of tools to choose for different purpose, we are going to discuss the list of few popular tools and technology.

#### NPM

NPM makes it easy for JavaScript developers to share and reuse code, and it makes it easy to update the code that you're sharing.

The npm command-line tool is bundled with Node.js. If you have it installed, then you already have npm too. If not, go download Node.js.

In project we need to add *****package.json***** file.

****package.json:**** This file is used by npm to store metadata for projects published as npm modules. You will list grunt and the Grunt plugins your project needs as devDependencies in this file.

```
{
  "name": "my-project-name",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "devDependencies": {
    "grunt": "~0.4.5",
    "grunt-contrib-jshint": "~0.10.0",
    "grunt-contrib-nodeunit": "~0.4.1",
    "grunt-contrib-uglify": "~0.5.0"
  }
}
```
#### Grunt     


- Grunt and Grunt plugins are installed and managed via npm, the Node.js package manager.
- Before setting up Grunt ensure that your npm is up-to-date by running npm update -g npm (this might require ***sudo*** on certain systems).

###### Installing the CLI
In order to get started, you'll want to install Grunt's command line interface (CLI) globally. This will put the grunt command in your system path, allowing it to be run from any directory.

```
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

Note that installing grunt-cli does not install the Grunt task runner! 

A typical setup will involve adding two files to your project: package.json and the Gruntfile.
The package.json file we already created before.

****Gruntfile:**** This file is named Gruntfile.js or Gruntfile.coffee and is used to configure or define tasks and load Grunt plugins. 

###### Installing Grunt and gruntplugins

The easiest way to add Grunt and gruntplugins to an existing package.json is with the command 
```
npm install <module> --save-dev. 
```
Not only will this install <module> locally, but it will automatically be added to the devDependencies section, using a tilde version range.

For example, this will install the latest version of Grunt in your project folder, adding it to your devDependencies:
```
npm install grunt --save-dev
```
The same can be done for gruntplugins and other node modules. As seen in the following example installing the JSHint task module:
```
 grunt-contrib-uglify --save-dev
```
###### The Gruntfile
The Gruntfile.js or Gruntfile.coffee file is a valid JavaScript or CoffeeScript file that belongs in the root directory of your project, next to the package.json file, and should be committed with your project source.

A Gruntfile is comprised of the following parts:
- The "wrapper" function
- Project and task configuration
- Loading Grunt plugins and tasks
- Custom tasks

```
module.exports = function(grunt) {

  // Project configuration.
  grunt.initConfig({
    pkg: grunt.file.readJSON('package.json'),
    uglify: {
      options: {
        banner: '/*! <%= pkg.name %> <%= grunt.template.today("yyyy-mm-dd") %> */\n'
      },
      build: {
        src: 'src/<%= pkg.name %>.js',
        dest: 'build/<%= pkg.name %>.min.js'
      }
    }
  });

  // Load the plugin that provides the "uglify" task.
  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-uglify');

  // Default task(s).
  grunt.registerTask('default', ['uglify']);

};
```
